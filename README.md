### Pixela Integration

To use Pixela, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Pixela Account**

   Sign up at [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) and create a new graph to track your time.

2. **Configure Pixela in Your Code**

3. **Save Data to Pixela**

   When you click the "Save" button, the application will attempt to upload your time data to Pixela. Ensure your Pixela configuration is correct to enable this feature.

### Configuration

You can customize the timer settings by adjusting the following variables in `main.py`:

- `SHORT_BREAK_MIN`: Duration of the short break in minutes.
- `LONG_BREAK_MIN`: Duration of the long break in minutes.
- `SAVE_FILE_NAME`: Name of the CSV file where your time data is saved.
- `MINUTE_X`, `MINUTE_Y`, `HOURS_X`, `HOURS_Y`: Coordinates for the floating window timer.

### Troubleshooting
    
- **Pixela Connection Issues**: Ensure you have a valid Pixela account and that your API token and graph details are correct.
- **Missing Libraries**: Make sure all required libraries are installed.
