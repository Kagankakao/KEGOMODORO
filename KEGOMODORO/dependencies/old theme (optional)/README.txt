The app originally looked like the provided images, but I later updated the themes. You can now customize them and adjust the colors accordingly.

Here are the old theme color hex values:

PINK: #e2979c
RED: #e7305b
GREEN: #77ed95
YELLOW: #f7f5dd
ORANGE: #fcba03
DEEP_BLUE: #281c3c
DEEP_RED: #249813
FONT_NAME: Courier
TOMATO_COLOR: #f26849
WHITE: #feffff

This may need minor tweaks, but you can use the old code if preferred. I'm also considering adding a mode-switching feature for more flexibility.
